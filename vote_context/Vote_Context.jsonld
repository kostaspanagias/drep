This name was chosen to honor Chang Feng, a Chinese astronomer & mathematician. So it was chosen to reflect Cardano's commitment to innovation and continuous progress as Chang Feng was a pioneer in his field. By honoring such significant figures, we not only acknowledge their contributions but also provide an opportunity for others to learn about their remarkable achievements."
