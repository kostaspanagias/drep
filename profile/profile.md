# Profile
I am a firm believer of decentralization and would love to see as many Dreps as possible provided that they don't take this responsibility lightly and they put the required effort to understand what they're voting for every time (unlike those in politics who vote blindly what their party mandate). Through this action, I hope to engage more with the community, study more about Cardano, navigate our expanding ecosystem and get into productive discussions with Cardano citizens on how a digital nation should be governed. 


My approach as a DRep will be rooted in transparency. I will provide clear reasoning for every voting decision I make and remain open to feedback from those who delegate to me. I welcome discussions on my decisions and am committed to engaging with the community to refine my perspectives. 


# Guiding Principles

My votes will always be in the direction of:

* **Greater Decentralization**: Strengthening the decentralized nature of Cardano's ecosystem.

* **Ecosystem Growth**: Supporting proposals that contribute to the healthy expansion of the Cardano network. 

* **Long-Term Vision**: Focusing on medium & long-term benefits over short-term "gains", in line with Cardano's development philosophy of: "steady wins the race" appoach. 

* **Sustainable & Justifiable Treasury Spending**: ensuring funds are spend responsibly and only for initiatives that collectively enhance the Cardano ecosystem. 

* **Deflation**: Maintain a deflationary monetary policy in block production & stake pool rewards. 

* **The Greater Good**: Making decisions that benefit the many rather than a select few.


# Motivation

We have build the first digital country, and now we are all its citizens. **It is both our duty and a unique privilege** to actively participate in the commons and have the power to shape the future of Cardano.

Becoming a DRep is one of the most meaningful ways to be actively engaged in the entire Cardano ecosystem, far beyond just the governance aspect. Watching the Cardano ecosystem flourish is my greatest motivation. It drives me to continue learning daily, engaging in meaningful discussions with the community, and educating others on the merits of Cardano.

If you would also support those initiatives and don't want to go through the process of registering yourself as a DRep *-which I encourage you to do so-*, you might want to consider delegating to me. My DRep ID is: **drep1xz3vmptcqz60srhcdxgr5uxrwm948zul8e0g6wewdhm3w3u5cln**
