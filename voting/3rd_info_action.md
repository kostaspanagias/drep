## DOCUMENT IS CURRENTLY IN STATUS: WORK IN PROGRESS

So, after having taken into consideration multiple sources such as:

- https://forum.cardano.org/t/pcp-001-k-parameter-and-minpoolcost/123713
- https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2022/10/27/staking-parameters-and-network-optimization-where-next-for-k-and-min-fee/
- https://www.lidonation.com/en/posts/lido-nation-votes-on-chain-for-k-parameter-and-minpoolcost-parameters/
- https://www.lidonation.com/en/posts/should-k-increased/

And private discussions with various members of Cardano community, including Stake Pool operators, my decision is to vote **"Yes"** in the 3rd info action.

My decision is influenced and ratified based on the following reasons:
- it's not a governance action that will actually be implemented but more like a poll to get an idea of how the community approach the issue and to engage the dreps in discussions and voting participation.
- There is an unanimously agreement that before such an action, there should be a carefull examination of the concequencies that such an increase would have. Therefore, we run no risk on making hasty decisions to increase the K number.
