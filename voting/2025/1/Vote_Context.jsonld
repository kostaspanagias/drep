    "comment": "# Rationale for Voting on the Cardano Constitution to Replace the Interim Constitution\n\nAfter careful consideration, I have decided to vote **YES** on the proposed Cardano Constitution.\n\nI have spent considerable time reading and studying the document and have also considered many other DReps’ comments, views, and voting rationales. I read other people’s rationales because no one knows everything, and I might be missing important context or an interesting viewpoint. I always try to broaden my perspectives and listen not only to those with whom I agree but, more importantly, to those with whom I disagree. Only with an open mind and a curious approach can someone form an educated opinion.\n\n## My rationale is based on the following points:\n\n1. **No Perceived Threats**  \n   I do not see how the proposed constitution poses any danger or threat to the community, the network, or individual ADA holders. Similarly, I cannot find a reason why not ratifying the constitution would leave us in a better position than after ratification.\n\n2. **Perfect is the enemy of good**  \n   I recognize that this constitution is a living document. Whether we refer to its tenets, its articles, or its guardrails, we—the ADA holders—have the power to change, discard, or amend parts of it. As such, spending enormous amounts of time indefinitely debating whether it is the perfect constitution is out of scope. There will never be a perfect document that is unanimously accepted in its entirety by all stakeholders.\n\n3. **Inclusivity Concerns**  \n   A lot of NO voters have expressed concerns about how inclusive the process was and how parts of the world are underrepresented or excluded. From my point of view, many delegates from various countries participated in the constitutional process. Would I want more people to take part? Yes. However, no matter how many delegates or countries are involved, it is impossible to include everyone. In good faith, I believe that the organizers tried to include as many as possible with the resources available at the time.\n\n4. **Lack of Definitions Concerns**  \n   Another concern raised by NO voters—and one that I share—is the lack of definitions in this draft. Definitions could add additional clarity by minimizing ambiguity and vagueness in how we interpret the constitution. However, there are always two ways to interpret any law: one is based on the “letter of the law,” and the other on the “spirit of the law.” I have always favored the latter. Therefore, even without definitions at this stage, I believe we are capable of adequately interpreting the constitution, understanding its essence or gist, and making informed decisions based on its spirit.\n\n5. **Liquid Democracy**  \n   We operate in a liquid democracy where it is easy to make changes when necessary. Thus, we are not bound by individuals acting on their own for long periods of time. The community has total control and can promptly take action to enforce changes if needed. If anything goes wrong, we have both technological capacity (e.g., liquid democracy mechanisms, social networks, communication tools) and community strength (a very strong international network) to enact and enforce changes at either the protocol level or in governance.\n\n6. **Incentives**  \n   There are strong incentives for most of the community to act in good faith. These incentives are tied to monetary rewards and price appreciation that result from a healthy network and community.\n\n---\n\n## Some Other Thoughts & Concerns\n\nMy current concerns are primarily around these areas:\n\n1. **Definitions**  \n   As discussed above, lack of definitions remains an issue but can be addressed through interpretation based on the “spirit of the law.” Definitions are expected to be amended at a later time.\n\n2. **Poor Governance Tooling**  \n   The current official governance tool—“gov.tools”—leaves much to be desired. While there has been some progress, we are still far from what DReps would wish for in terms of features and ease of use. Personally, I have struggled with including rationales in previous votes and registering a complete DRep profile. Additionally, governance statistics (e.g., voting percentages) have been found to be inaccurate at times. Thankfully, alternative tools like Tempo Vote have been extremely helpful. I strongly believe that many of these issues with gov.tools will be addressed soon.\n\n3. **Underrepresentation from Third-World Countries**  \n   People from third-world countries often have very low voting power and are vastly underrepresented in governance processes. For individuals in these communities, even registering as a DRep (which requires locking 500 ADA) can be prohibitively difficult. For example, Africa—a continent with a significant population—has less than 2% representation in governance processes despite Cardano’s stated goal of inclusivity and global representation. This stark contrast highlights a major challenge that we need to address collectively by developing solutions for better representation.\n\n---\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nIn summary, while there are valid concerns about inclusivity, tooling issues, and definitions within this draft constitution, I believe these challenges can be addressed over time through amendments and improvements driven by our community’s collective efforts. The proposed constitution provides a strong foundation for the governance of Cardano, while remaining flexible enough to evolve as needed. Therefore, I am confident that ratifying it is a step forward for our ecosystem."
