# RATIONALE FOR VOTING ON 2025 Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget - 7.5M â‚³ for community builders
I have decided to vote **ABSTAIN** on this Info Action.

While I support funding the individual proposals included in this Budget Info Action, I believe the way this Governance Action is structured is unconstitutional. Each budget proposal must have a named administrator responsible for managing disbursement, oversight, and reporting of funds. This is a key requirement of the Cardano Constitution.

Additionally, these proposals are already part of the 275M ADA budget Info Action, which is submitted and administered by Intersect. If both Info Actions are approved, it could create confusion and overlap in fund management.

I also understand the motivation behind submitting this budget Info Action - ensuring that only proposals with clear majority support (over 50% + 1 Lovelace of the 5.38B active voting stake) are included. However, I do not fully agree with the claim that the 275M Budget Info Action contains proposals lacking majority consensus. It is the responsibility of DReps to participate in Cardano governance and for delegators to choose their representatives. If some DReps did not vote on Ekklesia, I consider their non-participation as a form of abstention. Therefore, the 3.92B ADA voting participation in Ekklesia should be regarded as the effective active voting stake for this process.

**For these reasons (support of proposals, but unconstitutionality and duplication of the Info Action), I have chosen ABSTAIN.**
