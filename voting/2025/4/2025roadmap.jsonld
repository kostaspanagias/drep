    "comment": "I support all the initiatives on the 2025 Vision/Roadmap, hence I am voting \"Yes\" in this Info Action. The right emphasis is given to all of those items that will move Cardano forward, such as the work on scalability with Leios, the ZK proofs that will enable us to become a DeFi layer of Bitcoin (which has the potential to increase liquidity by a lot!), work on Babel Fees, Programmable Assets, Multiple Node Implementations and many other work items that I don't need to list one by one herein. My main concern was the lack of quantum resistance for which I had initially voted \"No\". After receiving feedback from the Intersect Product Committee, I understand that this item is on the list of research items (on the Research Working Group) and it's ongoing. So although we don't have a solid solution right now, we are on track for quantum readiness with quantum-resistance algorithms such as one-shot signatures and quantum key distribution."
