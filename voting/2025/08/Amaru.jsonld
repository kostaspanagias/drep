    "comment": "## Rationale for Voting on “Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget: Amaru Node Development 2025” Info Action\n\nI am voting **YES** on the Amaru Node Development 2025 proposal.\n\nThe Amaru node will significantly increase Cardano’s resilience and improve network security. As Cardano continues to onboard thousands of new users, transactions, and greater value, it is essential to ensure the system has **no single point of failure**. Amaru directly addresses this by introducing node diversity, thereby strengthening the network against potential disruptions.\n\nAdditionally, Amaru is expected to lower hardware requirements for stake pool operators, which will **further promote decentralisation** of the network. The choice to develop Amaru in Rust - a widely adopted programming language - will also broaden our developer base and attract new contributors to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nIn my view, the requested funding is fully justified by the value Amaru brings in terms of security, decentralisation, and network robustness. For these reasons, I am supporting this proposal."
