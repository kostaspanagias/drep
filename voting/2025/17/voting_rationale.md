# Summary
I have decided to vote "NO" in this governance action based on the following rationale.

# Rationale Statement
A [PDF version](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYHVNanVULPmgA3HybuQWEtpv26MiBWnSkxYspTTKfAN6) of this rationale is also made available.

I have decided to vote No based on the following rationale:

Firstly, I would like to express my great respect for the team behind this proposal and my confidence in their skills and well-meaning intentions.

Having said that, in line with earlier budget decisions and my explicitly stated opinions on budget spending, I want to reiterate that I take a conservative approach to fiscal policy, guided by spending no more than the yearly income from transaction fees. For this year, my votes during the budget process have almost reached that threshold, so I am more inclined to support only must-have proposals (not nice-to-have ones), such as urgent security improvements, critical tooling, or maybe even an extraordinary marketing campaign that would undeniably offer massive benefits in terms of user adoption.

Moreover, since this is the first year of governance and we are still testing the waters with the budget process, it is critical that we remain frugal and skeptical about all spending activities.

I would have preferred to see this proposal submitted during the budget process so I could weigh it against other marketing proposals or within Project Catalyst, where many marketing proposals are submitted.

In conclusion, I would love to see this proposal resubmitted in the 2026 budget process or in future rounds of Catalyst, but for now, I must say no.
