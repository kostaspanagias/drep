This figure strikes the right balance between prudent spending and supporting the ecosystem’s development needs.\n\nI also appreciate the thoughtful structuring of this NCL to cover not only the remainder of 2025 but also a significant portion of 2026. This approach provides continuity for ongoing and upcoming budget proposals, many of which are designed around 12-month cycles, and ensures that essential development can continue without unnecessary interruptions while we debate future budgets.\n\nFor these reasons, I am in strong support of this Info Action and I am voting YES."
