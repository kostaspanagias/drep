# 2. Individual discussions
Individual discussions with various members of Cardano community, including Stake Pool operators, my decision is to vote **"Yes"** in the 3rd info action.

# 3. Current Voting State
Current Voting State based on Gov Tools that indicate the will of DReps and SPOs - particularly with an increased emphasis on the later, due to their technical expertice and immediate effect of such as decision.
With approx. 70% of SPOs voting Yes as of: 2024.10.27

My decision is influenced and ratified based on the following reasons:
- it's not a governance action that will actually be implemented but more like a poll to get an idea of how the community approach the issue and to engage the dreps in discussions and voting participation.
- There is an unanimously agreement that before such an action, there should be a carefull examination of the concequencies that such an increase would have. Therefore, we run no risk on making hasty decisions to increase the K number.
- It seems that a minor increase in K parameter will not adversely impact SPOs because the saturation point will not be significantly lowered. Therefore the danger of lowered rewards is low. Such a slight increase may indicate our commitment to increase decentralization by indirectly encouraging better spread of the delegated ADA to more pools. This info-action is somewhat vaque since it does not clarify what the increase of "K" would be. If there was a case for a big increase (e.g. from 500 to 1000), it would greatly impact a large number of stake pools (all those with above 37 million ADA) and considering the "sticky" stake issue that many Stake Pools face, it would had a significant negative impact on Rewards. Therefore, in such case my decision would be "NO". Since there is no specific number for the increase, I would consider the info-action as a mere question of the likeness of increased decentralization and therefore my answer is "Yes".
