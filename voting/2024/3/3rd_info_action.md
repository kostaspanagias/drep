After having taken into consideration the following:

### 1. Documents & Articles 
Documents and Articles on the Web by reputable authors

### 2. Individual discussions
Individual discussions with various members of Cardano community, including Stake Pool operators, many of which took places in public spaces (such as discussions on the "X" platform) & are accessible upon inquiry.

### 3. Current Voting State
Current Voting State based on Gov Tools that indicate the will of DReps and SPOs - particularly with an increased emphasis on the later, due to their technical expertice and immediate effect of such as decision.

With approx. 70% of SPOs voting Yes as of: 2024.10.27

### 4. Thinking thoroughly about the matter
My reasoning is influenced and ratified by thoughts such as the following:
- it's not a governance action that will actually be implemented but more like a poll to get an idea of how the community approach the issue and to engage the dreps in discussions and voting participation.
- There is an unanimously agreement that before such an action, there should be a carefull examination of the concequencies that such an increase would have. That examination should be conducted by stakeholders with an expertise on Cardano parameters and detailed simulations would need to be ran to document the effects of such actions. Therefore, we run no risk on making hasty decisions that will destabilize the network or adversely effect stake pool operators, delegetors or rewards.
- It seems that a minor increase in K parameter will not adversely impact SPOs because the saturation point will not be significantly lowered. Therefore the danger of lowered rewards is low. Such a slight increase may indicate our commitment to increase decentralization by indirectly encouraging better spread of the delegated ADA to more pools.
- This info-action is vaque since it does not clarify what the increase of "K" would be. If there was a case for a big increase (e.g. from 500 to 1000), it would greatly impact a large number of stake pools (all those with above 37 million ADA) and taking also into consideration the "sticky" stake issue, which many Stake Pools face, it would had a **significant negative impact** on Rewards. Therefore, in such case my decision would be "NO". **However, since there is no specific number for the increase, I would consider this info-action as a mere question of the "likeness" or attractiveness of increased decentralization and solely that**.


## I came to the decision to vote **"Yes"** in the 3rd info action.
